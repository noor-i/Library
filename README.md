# Virtual-Lib ðŸ“–
A Virtual Library App built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, and Google's Gemini API. 

Allows users to manage a collection of books (add, remove, and toggle the read statuses). It also includes a book-finder chatbot through integrating the Gemini API with Node.js/Express.js for handling HTTP requests, routing user input, and managing API data flow.
