# Library App
This is a Library App built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to manage a collection of books, with the ability to add, remove, and toggle the read status of each book. The app demonstrates my proficiency in DOM manipulation, event handling, and dynamic content rendering.

## Features
* **Add Book:** Users can add a new book by filling out a form with the book's title, author, and year of publication.
* **Remove Book:** Each book in the library can be removed with a simple click on the "X" button.
* **Toggle Read Status:** Users can update the read status of a book by clicking on "Read" button (green : read / grey : unread).

## Ongoing Features
**Book Recommender (In Progress):**
* This feature will use AI-powered recommendations to suggest books based on the user's interests.
* Currently integrating a generative AI model (e.g., Cohere API) to provide personalized book suggestions.
* Users will be able to discover new books via an interactive chatbot or suggestion system on the "Discover" page.
